In this SQL, I'm querying a database called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

1# Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

select CustomerID, FirstName, LastName,Country 
From chinook1.customers
where Country !=USA;

2# Show only the Customers from Brazil

select CustomerID, FirstName, LastName,Country 
From chinook1.customers
where Country = Brazil; 

3# Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

select customers.FirstName,customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceID, invoices.InvoiceDate,
invoices.BillingCountry
from invoices
left join customers
on customers.CustomerId = invoices.CustomerId
where invoices.BillingCountry = 'Brazil'; 

4# Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

select * from employees
where title = 'Sales Agents';

5# Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

select distinct BillingCountry from invoices;

6# Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

select customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.Country,
invoices.Total, employees.FirstName, employees.LastName
from employees
Join customers on customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
join invoices on invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId;

7# How many Invoices were there in 2009?

select count(*) from invoices
where InvoiceDate between '2009-01-01' and '2009-12-31';

8# What are the total sales for 2009?

select sum(total) from invoices
where InvoiceDate between '2009-01-01' and '2009-12-31';

9# Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

select tracks.Name, invoice_items.InvoiceLineId
from tracks
join invoice_items
on tracks.TrackId = invoice_items.TrackId;
